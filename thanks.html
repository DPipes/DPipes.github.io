                            Howdy Friend! If you've found yourself here in my little corner of the interwebs, it's
			    because you mean a lot to me and I wanted to express my gratitude for your friendship.</br></br>

			    I would have sent a letter, but I wanted to include a short video and have no idea where I'd get
			    enough VHS tapes to send everybody I want to thank.</br></br>

			    I'm not too great at stringing words together so I'll just steal a few simple words that others have said
			    to get my point across -</br></br>

			    I read the great fishing tale <em>A River Runs Through It</em>, by Norman Maclean, yesterday
                            and in it he defines help as "giving part of yourself to somebody who comes to accept it willingly
                            and needs it badly." I am immensely grateful for the help you have given to me and would like
			    you to know that if there is ever a part of myself that I can offer back, I would in an instant.</br></br>

			    The next person whose words I would plagiarize is the troubadour known as Matt the Electrician.
			    He wrote the very pretty song I included below, though it was I that took it upon myself to
			    ruin it with my singing.</br></br>

			    Your friend,</br>
			    Dan Piper
