                            Hi di ho neighbor!</br> </br>

				    Another year comes and goes and I just wanted to pass on a brief message of gratefulness for all that you have done for me. </br></br>

				    Words like 'lucky' and 'blessed' get thrown around a lot and I've always had a bit of a problem with it. I think folks often attribute good fortune or fate to things that came through great effort and determination. Everybody seems to be venturing in new directions (moving, new jobs, big life choices, etc.) and it is just so darn exciting to see. I've always been more of a critical person than complimentary, but I am so impressed by the awesome things that you are accomplishing and I appreciate having someone as extraordinary as you to call a friend.

				    I can't imagine what I've done to deserve it, but having a friend like you sure does make me feel lucky. Thanks.

			          Dan</br></br></br>
