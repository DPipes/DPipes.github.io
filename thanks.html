			Howdy Pal!</br></br>

			As we gather around for another year of turkey, stuffing, and a few too many slices of pie, I've been thinking a lot about the here and now – about savoring today and all the joy it brings.</br></br>

			If you've found yourself back in my little slice of the internet, you add something special to my life. It's like every laugh, every shared memory, and every bit of support you've given me are rays of sunshine on a cloudy day, bringing warmth and brightness to my life when I need it most. I'm reminded today, more than ever, just how precious these moments are.</br></br>

			In the spirit of this, I recorded a song taught to me by my dear friend Carl England. It's about embracing today, finding joy in the little things, and being grateful for the wonderful friends I have in you. I hope it conveys in some way just how important your friendship is to me.</br></br>

			So here's to a day of warmth, love, and gratitude. Here's to us and to the many more moments we'll share.</br></br>

			Thankful for you, today and always,</br>
			Dan</br></br>
